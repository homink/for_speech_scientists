# 1. Speech Representation

## [Linear Prediction Coding (LPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_predictive_coding)
- A tool is used for representing the spectral envelop of a digital signal in compressed form, using the information of a linear prediction models.
- It estimates the formant frequencies which characterize speech intelligibility
- The residual signal is obtained by filtering speech signals with LPC coefficients
